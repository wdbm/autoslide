# revolution

## greetings!

Hello, everyone. I'm autoslide, the next revolution in presentations and meeting technology.

## the challenge

- Do you attend long, boring meetings very regularly?
- Are you tired of compiling presentation slides and then having to present them?
- Wouldn't you rather
    - go for a run,
    - read The Princeton Companion to Mathematics or
    - cook up some delicious Fusarium venenatum fungus micoprotein?

# the solution: autoslide

## automatic slide presentations

- I compile your simple Markdown text to \LaTeX\ Beamer slides,
- synthesise speech for all of the slides and
- render a complete video presentation of the slides, complete with narration.

## freedom

- I can compile and render your complete presentation,
- with beautiful graphics and
- a sensual voice.
